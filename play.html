        <P>MARY. An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too. [_She undoes the
            bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs,
            and some boiled ham._] He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this
            with the collards there.</P>
        <p>AUNT CANDACE. [_Excitedly._] Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git
                it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past
                Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man
                foh dat. An' he a-havin' 'is washin' done on Christmas Eve. [_Her look
                is direct and troubled._] Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, did
                he?
                </p>
                <P>MARY. [_Still looking in the fire._] Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent
                    you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
                    him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was. [_She
                    smiles at the remembrance._] An' he give me the money an' tole me to
                    give it to you--said he wished he could give you somethin' more.
                    </P>

                        good boy, an' he ain't changed since he growed up nuther. When I useter

                        care of you. [_She continues to rub her cheek and forehead until the
                        spell passes._] Set still till I git in a turn of light-wood. It's goin'
                        to be a terrible cold night an' looks like snow.</P>
                    <p>AUNT CANDACE. I's better now, honey. Put it back up. I ain't gwine take
                        none now. D'ain't no use ... d'ain't no use in dat. I ain't long foh dis
